										<h2>Week 1: Intro</h2>
									</header>
									<p>For my first week I went through the GitHub and HTML readings and set up my website. I was able to bring in some information cards using bootstrap that will represent each weeks assignments, as well as a nav bar to navigate my different pages(About, Final Project, Weeks). I wasn’t happy with this but am not super comfortable with CSS so I used and HTML5 template to bring in some cleaner styling. I added to this template using bootstrap and removed unnecessary components. I downloaded Fusion360 and watched some tutorials so I could begin to sketch and model. Finally, I started brainstorming ideas for my final project, and was gravitated towards a simple dorm room door addition to add security and privacy.</p>

												<h3>Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting</h3>
											</header>
											<p>For the first project, I used Fusion360 to sketch a 2D layout to cut in cardboard using the laser cutter. First I learned the basics of Fusion360. Most important was creating shapes and curves, making cuts, and setting presets for dimensions and kerf.
To create shapes, the shape of choice(rectangle in my choice) can be selected from the top menu when sketching, and by dragging, the exact dimensions of the rectangle can be determined. From here I used the rounding tool to round the corners for aesthetics.
I then set out to make a modular press fit construction model. I decided to go for something simple yet practical, and made a desk organizer cube out of 4 cardboard rectangles. After measuring the width of the cardboard, I added in my expected kerf(about .2 mm) and was able to make cutouts to attach my rectangles. The design was simple enough, four rectangles, each with 2 slots cut out with the cutout width equivalent to the width of the cardboard stock and the cutout height equivalent to half the total height of the rectangle. This allowed my rectangles to seemlessly fit together in different combinations, chiefly a box of consistent height.
I copied 4 of these rectangles and used the shape drawing and delete tool to created different sized cutouts in the center of each rectangle. This way, when oriented in different configurations or when laying on different faces, the organizer box is capable of holding different objects, from pens and pencils, to cups, to flash cards and much more.
The rectangles can also be fitted together in a zig-zag pattern allowing them to hold items at different angles and in a different form factor. This week, I also modeled my Mather room doorknob, as my final project may involve blocking the doorknob, or building around the doorknob. I figure it will be useful to have a scale model of the doorknob. I used calipers to determine the 57mm diameter of the door knob, and free modeled the knob itself using sketch and rotate in Fusion360. 
My second model was of a door-mounted hook system I use to hang towels, bags and other hangable items. The mount fits over top of the door and secures the hooks to the side of the door, perpendicular to the door itself. I measured the thickness of the door to be about 50mm. This mounted hook could be the basis for mounting my deadbolt. I want to be able to install the deadbolt without using and screws or drilling holes. It is meant to provide a little additional privacy, not deter people trying to break in so it doesn’t have to be too sturdy. I will need to work on materials and measure how much room there is between the top of the door and the door frame.

												<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This week, we used our accumulated knowledge to build kinetic sculptures. I got COVID and missed class and lab this week, but was still able to make a cool kinetic sculpture. This project was fairly open ended, and I just needed to use a motor in a cool way. My idea was to create a spinning wheel that was mounted upright(perpendicular to the ground). I would then use the vinyl cutter to cut out a cool optical illusion, and apply it to my spinning wheel to create the full moving illusion. I first tried laser cutting gears on the laser cutter to hook up the motor to the cardboard disc I wanted to spin, but I ran into issues having them turn smoothly and ultimately opted to attach the disc directly to the motor shaft. My design was fairly simple. I would cut one cardboard disc as the backplate, one smaller disc that would eventually attach to the motor, one disc with the center cut out act as a sort of frame for my illusion disc. I used laser cut cardboard clips to keep the sculpture upright and also keep the backdrop and frame discs attached. I then glued my continuous servo motor down to the backdrop disc, and glued the illusion disc to the motor shaft using a little Lego piece to connect the two pieces. I then vinyl cut a cool hypnotic wheel spiral design in black and white to yield the final product. When it came to power, I used a motor driver and arduino at, but the breadboard worked just as well. I created a simple circuit to power the motor when a button was pressed, and the sculpture spun great and looked great! I was really happy that I was able to achieve the optical illusion better than I expected to be able to. Using the multimeter, I measured the voltage across the motor to be 4.58 V, and I was using no resistors. I am unsure the resistance of the motor itself so I could not calculate the current.</p>
