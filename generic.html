										<h1>Final Project</h1>

									<p>For my final project, I would like to make a bluetooth controlled deadbolt for use in the frame of doors and windows. My roommate likes to tape over the bolt on our door so we don't need to use keys, so I was inspired to create something that is fairly simple to install and easier to use than a traditional key. My plan is to mill/print the deadbolt and housing and mount it over the top of the door with a bracket. The deadbolt would work with a stepper motor that retracts and extends the bolt(possibly with threading) and an arduino to control the state of the bolt over bluetooth or internet. Depending on ease of implementation, I'm interested in creative ways to unlock the deadbolt, like a secret knock, pass phrase, or basic facial recognition. Alternatively, I may make a Bluetooth doorknob. This would involve fitting a machined piece over my existing doorknob that would only allow for the knob to be turned if a certain requirement is met. This could be an RFID sensor, a Bluetooth signal, or some unique light or vibration pattern.</p>

										<h1>Final Project V2</h1>

									<p>As I continue to iterate and think about my final project, I’ve decided to tweak a few things. Instead of building a prototype that would fit over door frames, I decided it would be more simple to make a device that would simply fit over the knob itself, and selectively allow one to turn the knob, based on inputs from a piezo sensor on the door. This would be easier as the doorknobs here at Harvard are more standardized than the door frames. This allows me to use my device on many different doors at Harvard, and on most standard circular doorknobs. Just like the initial version, this is not meant to deter people from breaking in, but more to add a layer of privacy in busy suites. While it wouldn't be too difficult to remove the device, hopefully most people would understand that if the doorknob doesn’t turn, they shouldn’t try to enter the room by force. I will prototype this in cardboard, and for the final version I plan to 3D print a housing that fits around the base of the door knob, as well as another piece for the doorknob itself. A motor with a perpendicular shaft attached to the base will occupy a slot in the knob attachment, preventing the turning of the knob when locked. A specific sequence of knocks will temporarily disengage the locking mechanism, allowing the knob to turn freely.</p>

									<p>For my final product, I first needed to print the base of the mechanism, which would be fixed in place. The base houses the stepper motor and must be very rigid and snug over the base of the doorknob. I 3D printed this piece in PLA after taking careful measurements of the doorknob to ensure a good fit. Next I printed the cover which would go over the knob itself. I made sure to set the first layer print speed low to ensure a smooth base layer, as this piece would have to move as the knob was turned and I didn’t want friction or an uneven fit. This piece also had a slot cutout where the lockbar attached to the motor would slot in when the locking mechanism was in the locked position. I then printed a small shaft that would fit over the metal shaft of the stepper motor, so that the printed shaft could assume a position parallel(unlocked) to the door or perpendicular(locked). Next I put together the circuit. I ended up using an Arduino Uno because I was having trouble constantly uploading code to my ESP32. I ran the device off my computer which also made it easier to test new code. I then wired the stepper motor to the motor driver, and connected the driver to pins 8,9, 10 and 11 on the Uno to gain control over the motor, and connected ground and VCC to the breadboard so I could use the piezo sensor for input. I added the piezo sensor and resistor, and attached this to A0 on the Uno. The piezo sensor did not work nearly as well or as consistently as I’d hoped, and I had to scrap the idea of a secret knock in favor of a firm knock in a certain location on the door. When the piezo sensor read no vibrations, it output a “press value” of zero, but with a firm knock this would increase to 5-10. There were very few false positives and I found the piezo a bit difficult to trigger accidentally, so I set two positions for the motor, locked and unlocked, with any “press value” of 1 or higher triggering the unlocked position for one second before returning to the locked position. The stepper motor I used had shorter steps in the counterclockwise direction and I had to compensate by making this value nearly double the number of steps clockwise to have both movements follow an equidistant arc. I’m not sure why this was but after a good bit of trial and error I had the stepper oscillating between two set positions. The trickiest part of this was mounting the assembly to the door. I had initially planned to use a smaller motor, so my new stepper motor was too large to fit and I had to add a couple layers of cardboard so that it could fit in the base module without obstructing the turning of the knob in the unlocked orientation. For mounting I used a mix of double sided adhesive and duct tape. This created an impermanent and somewhat rough looking product but it held up very well. In practice the knob worked as planned, and the locking mechanism was more solid than I anticipated. I was able to apply a fair amount of pressure when locked without compromising the lock or damaging the assembly. Due to the circular form of the knob, there wasn’t much for the knob attachment to grib onto and I had to add several round of adhesive for the knob to turn freely with the attached assembly. I ended up using leftover silicone putty reinforced with tape, but in the future I’d make this more secure. Overall, I was satisfied with how the lock functioned, though the piezo sensor stopped detecting quick knocks and required more of a press than a tap. If I were to do this again, I would use stronger materials, especially adhesives, but I didn’t want to do anything permanent to Harvard property. I’d also like to try this code on and ESP32 so it wouldn’t require a computer for power, as this was the main thing getting in the way of me using this daily. Finally, as I mentioned before, I would use a different sensor to unlock the door. I thought the idea of a secret knock was pretty cool and sort of something out of a spy movie, but in reality the piezo sensor I used was not precise or consistent enough to detect specific sequences of knocks. I like the idea of basic face recognition, or a specific passphrase, but I think using facial or speech recognition would be very challenging for me to implement. Hopefully I can refine this project in the future as I have received a lot of interest from friends and classmates who wish they had a little more privacy!</p>
