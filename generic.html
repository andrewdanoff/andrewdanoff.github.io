									<p>For my final project, I would like to make a bluetooth controlled deadbolt for use in the frame of doors and windows. My roommate likes to tape over the bolt on our door so we don't need to use keys, so I was inspired to create something that is fairly simple to install and easier to use than a traditional key. My plan is to mill/print the deadbolt and housing and mount it over the top of the door with a bracket. The deadbolt would work with a stepper motor that retracts and extends the bolt(possibly with threading) and an arduino to control the state of the bolt over bluetooth or internet. Depending on ease of implementation, I'm interested in creative ways to unlock the deadbolt, like a secret knock, pass phrase, or basic facial recognition. Alternatively, I may make a Bluetooth doorknob. This would involve fitting a machined piece over my existing doorknob that would only allow for the knob to be turned if a certain requirement is met. This could be an RFID sensor, a Bluetooth signal, or some unique light or vibration pattern.</p>

									<p>As I continue to iterate and think about my final project, I’ve decided to tweak a few things. Instead of building a prototype that would fit over door frames, I decided it would be more simple to make a device that would simply fit over the knob itself, and selectively allow one to turn the knob, based on inputs from a piezo sensor on the door. This would be easier as the doorknobs here at Harvard are more standardized than the door frames. This allows me to use my device on many different doors at Harvard, and on most standard circular doorknobs. Just like the initial version, this is not meant to deter people from breaking in, but more to add a layer of privacy in busy suites. While it wouldn't be too difficult to remove the device, hopefully most people would understand that if the doorknob doesn’t turn, they shouldn’t try to enter the room by force. I will prototype this in cardboard, and for the final version I plan to 3D print a housing that fits around the base of the door knob, as well as another piece for the doorknob itself. A motor with a perpendicular shaft attached to the base will occupy a slot in the knob attachment, preventing the turning of the knob when locked. A specific sequence of knocks will temporarily disengage the locking mechanism, allowing the knob to turn freely.</p>
